# "Build Habits" JS App
My intention is to build a **simple JavaScript app** that can help you **create habits that last**.
<br>
<br>
The idea is to make a **SPA app out of a book** I like - ["Atomic Habits" by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits). The book is designed with steps for fulfilling one's desire to **build a habit from start to end** and I want to **create an interactive guide** for this, following the book.
